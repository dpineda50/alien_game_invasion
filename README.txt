To play the game download the zip or clone the git into a directory. 

Next find the directory that the folder is in. Usually it is your Downloads
Documents folder. On Mac OS X, open up your Terminal and write

cd ~/Downloads/alien_invasion/play.py

where Downloads is switched with the folder in which the folder downloaded to.
Finally type 

python play.py
